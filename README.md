✨ Core Features
This platform was built from the ground up and includes a comprehensive set of features for any modern financial application:

🧠 AI-Powered Predictions: Enter any valid stock or crypto symbol to receive a "Buy," "Sell," or "Hold" signal generated by a combination of technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD), complete with a confidence score.

📊 Interactive Charts & News: Every prediction is accompanied by a clean, historical price chart and a real-time feed of the latest news for that specific asset, fetched from the Finnhub API.

🔐 Secure User Authentication: A complete user account system with secure registration and login. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt, and sessions are managed with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

⭐ Personalized Watchlist: Logged-in users can add stocks directly from the prediction results to a personal watchlist, which is securely saved to their account in a MongoDB database.

🚀 Nexus AI Copilot: A standout feature! An integrated chat assistant powered by the Google Gemini API with search grounding enabled. Users can ask real-time financial questions, get news updates, and interact with an intelligent AI to gain deeper market insights.
